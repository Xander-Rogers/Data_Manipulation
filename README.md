# Byte_Matching

This is an example of how file handling in python can be used to search for characterstics of data.

The file used in the program is Binary.txt, however any length of binary text can be implemented, 

as long as the range of the binary values are updated in the byte_match.py.

All of these are up for public disposal, and can be modified or redistributed for educational purposes.
